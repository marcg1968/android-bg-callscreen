# Android Call Screening App

## About

This is a small Android Java app with a background service (started on boot) to screen calls
according to specified numers.
 
***Note:***

1. This app was developed mainly as an exercise and in fact replaces existing functionality
present on most Android devices.
1. This version is optimized for a somewhat older version (``android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK = 23``).

The main purpose is as a reference app for:

* starting and running a background service;
* GUI widgets on older Android versions; and
* prompting for required permissions.
